<!-- * Implement sphere-based query -->
* Implement querying Atom or Residue Names
* Accept ranges in command line list input
    - write function to replace use of values_of_t
* Maybe refactor with subcommands
    - add enums for modes
    - write parsing function that returns an enum variant (based on mode chosen) which contains a struct of command line flags given (which in turn contain potential data)
* Write tests
