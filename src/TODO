* rewrite the function logic to pass around Atom structs, not indices

#* Accept ranges in command line list input
#    - write function to replace use of values_of_t
#* move validation of command line arguments (i.e. List) to argparse module (clap validator_regex) for some reason clap doesn't recognize this so regular validator was used with separate function
#* Implement querying Atom or Residue Names
#* Implement sphere-based query
#* change parsing of List input in add and remove modes
#* move run to lib.rs
#* improve error handling of reading pdb file
#* Maybe refactor with subcommands
#    - add enums for modes
#    - write parsing function that returns an enum variant (based on mode chosen) which contains a struct of command line flags given (which in turn contain potential data)
#* Write tests
